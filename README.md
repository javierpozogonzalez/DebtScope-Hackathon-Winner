## 💡 The Challenge
**The Problem:** The non-performing loan (NPL) management process in banking is often rigid, impersonal, and inefficient. Traditional recovery strategies fail to account for the specific context of each client, leading to low recovery rates and poor customer experience.

**The Goal:** To build a solution that uses technology to humanize debt recovery, creating personalized strategies that benefit both the bank (higher recovery) and the client (financial health).

---

## 🤖 The Solution: DebtScope
**DebtScope** is an intelligent risk-analysis engine powered by **Generative AI**. It moves beyond simple credit scores to understand the *narrative* behind the debt.

### Core Capabilities:
1.  **Deep Profiling:** Analyzes transaction patterns to detect if a default is situational (e.g., job loss) or structural.
2.  **Hyper-Personalized Strategy:** Generates a tailored repayment plan that fits the user's real-time spending capacity.
3.  **Empathetic Communication:** Uses LLMs to script conversations for bank agents that are persuasive yet supportive, adapting the tone to the client's emotional state.
